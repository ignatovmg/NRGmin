Energy minimization using LBFGS.

A molecule can be passed using two modes: single file mode or rec/lig mode.
Rec/lig mode is used, when structure is passed using rec-* lig-* arguments,
and single file mode is enabled for the opposite. Structure can be passed
using a set of 4 files pdb, psf, rtf, prm or as a single json file which
contains coordinates as well as force field parameters. Also and pair of
json and pdb can be passed, if one want to use geometry from json and
coordinates from pdb.

All flags can be as well filled by passing a global setup file to --setup-json,
so this one argument is enough to run minimization.

Examples of different minimization setups can be found in examples/energy_setup.

    Output control:

    --out-pdb Where to write the minimized molecule(s)
    --out-json Log file with energy terms
    --print-step Log energies for every step
    --print-stage Log energies for every stage
    --print-noe-matrix Log NOE matrix is NOE calculation is on
    --verbosity 0 - QUIET, 1 - ERROR, 2 - WARNING, 3 - INFO, >=4 - DEBUG


    Single file mode:

    --psf Geometry
    --prm Forcefield parameters
    --rtf Topology file with residues description
    --pdb Atom coordinates (can contain multiple models)
    --json Json file with coordinates, geometry and force field parameters

    Parameters for rec/lig mode

    --rec-psf Receptor geometry
    --rec-prm Receptor forcefield parameters
    --rec-rtf Receptor topology file
    --rec-pdb Receptor atom coordinates (can contain multiple models)
    --rec-json Receptor json file with coordinates, geometry and force field parameters
    --lig-psf Ligand geometry
    --lig-prm Ligand forcefield parameters
    --lig-rtf Ligand topology file with residues description
    --lig-pdb Ligand atom coordinates (can contain multiple models)
    --lig-json Ligand json file with coordinates, geometry and force field parameters


    Minimization setup

    --nsteps Number of minimization steps

    Energy terms switches. Everything is on by default except for GBSA

    --bonds-on/--bonds-off Bonds energy term
    --angles-on/--angles-off Angles
    --dihedrals-on/--dihedrals-off Dihedrals
    --impropers-on/--impropers-on Impropers
    --vdw-on/--vdw-off VDW
    --vdw03-on/--vdw03-off 1-4 VDW
    --gbsa-on/gbsa-off GBSA

    Fixed atoms (in rec/lig mode ligand atom IDs must be increased by the number of receptor atoms)

    --fixed-pdb PDB file with fixed atoms. Only atom ID is read (lines starting with ATOM)
    --fix-receptor Fix receptor atoms (works only in rec/lig mode)
    --fix-ligand Fix ligand atoms (works only in rec/lig mode)

    Distance restraints

    --pair-springs-txt Text file setup for pairwise restraints
    --point-springs-txt Text file setup for pointwise restraints

    NOE setup

    --noe-txt Text file setup for NOE
    --noe-json Json file setup for NOE

    Density setup

    --density-json Json file setup for density fitting

    Global setup in json format

    --setup-json This file duplicates all the other options. It also allows for
                 multistage minimization protocol, where each stage can have
                 different minimization terms

    Miscellaneous

    --score-only Score only without doing minimization
    --help Show this message and exit
